## 📖 What is This Project?

**Git Conventional Commits Practice** is an interactive web application designed to help developers, teams, and organizations learn and master the art of writing meaningful commit messages. Think of it as a comprehensive learning platform that transforms how you communicate changes in your code.

### 🎯 **For Non-Developers:**

Imagine you're working on a project with a team, and every time someone makes a change, they write a note about what they did. This application teaches people how to write these notes in a clear, consistent way that everyone can understand. It's like teaching someone how to write professional emails - there's a right way to do it that makes communication clearer and more effective.

### 🎯 **For Developers:**

This is a production-ready Next.js application that serves as both a learning tool and a reference guide for conventional commits, Git workflows, and GitHub best practices. It features a complete internationalization system, accessibility compliance, and modern React architecture.
